          <p>Although we want to provide a great service, there are certain things about
            the service that cannot be promised. For example, the services and software are
            provided "as-is", at your own risk, without express or implied warranty or
            condition of any kind. Ewolo also disclaims any warranties of merchantability,
            fitness for a particular purpose or non-infringement. Ewolo will have no
            responsibility for any harm to your computer system, loss or corruption of data,
            or other harm that results from your access to or use of the Services or
            Software.</p>
          <p>
            These Terms can change at any time, but we will never be unreasonable. This
            product is a dream come true for us and we hope to run it as long as possible.
